Sonar used to be a multi-purpose private discord bot featuring over 100 commands ranging from moderation, music, and fun stuff. 

Note: Sonarbot is now obsolete after many API changes, server changes, and the rise of lawsuits against the developers of discord bots.
Sonarbot may return if Discord becomes stable once more and stops taking legal action against developers who only wish to contribute to the platform in a positive way.
I'm making this repo public for the time being so that others may try to continue what I started. Contact me on discord (sencerity#7776) if you desire to use the code from this bot, and please do credit me as well
hundreds of hours were spent creating this bot so I'd like the fruits of my labor to be appreciated and honored.
